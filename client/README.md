# Introduction

**The gRPC service** combines two main functionalities: Chat and User. This service provides communication capabilities through the Chat service and user management functionalities through the User service. It leverages the power of gRPC, a high-performance and language-agnostic remote procedure call (RPC) framework, to facilitate efficient communication between clients and the server.

# Implement the client-side code

This will send requests to the server and receive responses. You can create one or more client processes as needed.
