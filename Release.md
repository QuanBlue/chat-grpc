# Release Template

## Tag

-  It’s common practice to prefix your version names with the letter `v`. Some good tag names might be `v1.0.0` or `v2.3.4`.

-  If the tag isn’t meant for production use, add a pre-release version after the version name. Some good pre-release versions might be `v0.2.0-alpha` or `v5.9-beta`.3.
